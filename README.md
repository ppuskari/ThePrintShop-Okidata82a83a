# The Print Shop – Okidata MICROLINE 82A/83A OkiGraph I Driver

Apple II printer-driver work for **Brøderbund The Print Shop v2**, targeting
the **Okidata MICROLINE 82A and 83A with OkiGraph I firmware**.

## Current status

**R2 executable disk build: implemented and CI-validated; physical printer validation is next.**

The original Print Shop v2 source already contains a dedicated
`OKIDATA MICROLINE 92,93` printer type. That path is an unusually good
starting point for the 82A/83A OkiGraph I driver because it already:

- converts the application's 120-column/inch graphics stream to a
  60-column/inch Okidata stream by merging source-column pairs;
- reverses the lower seven graphics bits for Okidata pin order;
- enters graphics with `$03`;
- leaves graphics with `$03 $02`; and
- uses Okidata `ESC % 9 n` programmable line spacing.

The v0.1 driver deliberately repurposes that printer type instead of adding
a tenth selector immediately.

The graphics-byte conversion becomes:

```
wire = $80 | reverse7(source0 | source1)
```

Forcing bit 7 high preserves the seven dot bits while preventing graphics
data from ever colliding with OkiGraph's ETX (`$03`) command prefix.

## Low-risk first build

The initial patch is intentionally layout-preserving:

- the new printer-menu label is the same 23 characters as the original;
- the modified `GC5` machine-code region remains exactly 20 bytes;
- the fixed `PRCOMS` jump table at `$1800` is unchanged;
- Print Shop's printer-interface-card code is untouched; and
- the existing type-5 line-spacing path is retained for hardware validation.

The assembly core is in [`src/OKI8283.S`](src/OKI8283.S).

## Runnable disk build

The historical sources now assemble into real executable overlays with
Merlin32. An untouched control build was compared against the archived
`ColorPrintShop.DSK` runtime:

- `PRCOMS`: 1,962 bytes, exact byte-for-byte match, load address `$1800`
- `MENUS7`: 3,014 bytes, exact byte-for-byte match, load address `$6300`

That establishes a compatible runtime base for this source snapshot.

To build the actual runnable disk on Windows:

```powershell
.\scripts\Build-RuntimeDisk.ps1
```

It creates:

```
build-runtime\PrintShop-Okidata82a83a-OkiGraphI.dsk
```

Current R2 validated image:

```
size   143360 bytes
SHA256 e404a536a5889ef051f58434b664fbcab22f31e060a9cd4c8077247a5e18d0f9
```

R2 keeps the proven OkiGraph raster encoding and replaces the legacy ML92/93
vertical-control behavior. Type-5 text CR/LF no longer sends `ESC % 9 n`.
After a completed graphics chunk, the driver uses native OkiGraph graphics
feed+CR (`$03 $0E`) and explicitly exits graphics (`$03 $02`) before the next
Print Shop graphics transaction.

The script uses an installed Merlin32 if available; otherwise it downloads
the pinned v1.1.10 Windows build. It verifies the original runtime overlays
against the control build before changing the disk, then rewrites only
`PRCOMS` and `MENUS7` through their existing DOS T/S chains and verifies
both files after read-back.

See [`docs/EXECUTABLE-BUILD.md`](docs/EXECUTABLE-BUILD.md) for the complete
reproducibility and validation record.

## Build / validate on Windows

From the repository root:

```powershell
.\scripts\Build-DriverSource.ps1
```

That performs the wire-model unit tests, checks the patch against the actual
1987 Print Shop v2 source snapshot, and produces decoded patched source plus
a complete three-disk local source set:

```
build\PRCOMS.OKI.S
build\MENUS7.OKI.S
build\PrintShop-V2-OkiGraph-source-1.dsk
build\PrintShop-V2-OkiGraph-source-2.dsk
build\PrintShop-V2-OkiGraph-source-3.dsk
```

Equivalent individual commands:

```powershell
py -3 -m unittest discover -s tests -v
py -3 tools\patch_printshop_source.py --check
py -3 tools\patch_printshop_source.py --output-dir build --output-disks build
```

Source disks 1 and 2 contain the rewritten files; source disk 3 is copied
unchanged so the build directory contains a complete set. The historical
Brøderbund source and generated disk images are **not committed to this repository**.

## Validation status

GitHub Actions currently verifies:

- seven-bit reversal;
- 120-to-60 column conversion;
- bit 7 set on every graphics-data byte;
- the legacy raw-`$03` collision becomes `$83`;
- OkiGraph transaction framing;
- existing type-5 line-spacing encoding; and
- exact applicability of the source patch to the 1987-01-26 source disks;
- DOS source-disk rewrite/read-back through the original T/S chains;
- untouched Merlin32 control overlays against the shipped runtime;
- patched executable overlay sizes and hashes;
- in-place runtime-disk replacement with preserved load addresses; and
- the complete Windows build producing a deterministic 143,360-byte `.dsk`.

## Source basis

Print Shop v2 interface discovery uses the three-disk source snapshot dated
**1987-01-26** from the Asimov Apple II archive.

OkiGraph I protocol behavior is based on the independent ROM reconstruction
and hardware work in:

https://github.com/ppuskari/Okidata-Microline-82A-83A

## Next milestone

Validate the R2 disk on the physical 82A/83A. The specific targets are removal
of the stray control/text output at graphics transitions, elimination of the
extra vertical gap between seven-dot bands, and restoration of one-page layout.

The first gate is the retained `ESC % 9 n` line-spacing command. If that
works as expected, the next source build can preserve the original 92/93
driver as type 5 and add **82A/83A OkiGraph I as a distinct printer type 10**.
